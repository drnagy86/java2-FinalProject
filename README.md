# Java 2 Final Project
*Fall, 2021*

This is the final project for my CIS-175 Java 2 course at Kirkwood Community College.

## Introduction

Reflecting on the Introduction module, I gained a better understanding of classes. It was good to review and feel confident that I know how to create classes in Java. This includes creating fields, getter and setter methods, constructors, and “to string” methods. It was also useful to learn about IntilliJ code generation. I had never used IntiliJ so it was interesting to learn some of its features and how it is different from VS Code, which I have more familiarity with.

I only knew a little about MarkDown and this was a nice refresher on how it works and the various text editing that can be done with it. I can see how it would be helpful to write documentation in readme files on GitHub.

## Abstract Classes, Interfaces, Lambda Expressions

When first learning about object-oriented programming, it seemed useful to be able to create a class that could be extended. It also seems very useful as a way to keep code DRY.

It was interesting to learn about the code contract that interfaces create. Understanding that it is an unimplementable set of method definitions was a little confusing at first but seeing how they are applied filled in some gaps in my understanding of polymorphism. It is also interesting to see how dependency inversion is applied to achieve loose coupling to an interface. I can see the advantages of letting the programmer decide how the implementation should work. This will change the way I write code.

I was aware that there was something called Lambda expressions but not sure how it worked exactly. Learning about functional interfaces really puts the pieces together as far as understanding how it works. It still is tricky because much is abstracted away but now I understand more about how Lambda expressions work under the hood.


## Open Source Projects
My GitHub knowledge previously focused on being able to do add-commit-push. I was more or less using a project repository as a way of backing up a project or sharing.

I learned more about how branches work. I think it will change the way I work with code. I like that you could create a branch and the main, working branch is safe.

I also learned a lot more about how forks work, as well as well as how remote and local repositories interact with each other. It seemed confusing but now I see how the various pieces interact with each other and the importance of doing a pull request on the origin’s upstream.
