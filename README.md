# Java 2 Final Project
*Fall, 2021*

This is the final project for my CIS-175 Java 2 course at Kirkwood Community College.

## Introduction

Reflecting on the Introduction module, I gained a better understanding of classes. It was good to review and feel confident that I know how to create classes in Java. This includes creating fields, getter and setter methods, constructors, and “to string” methods. It was also useful to learn about IntilliJ code generation. I had never used IntiliJ so it was interesting to learn some of its features and how it is different from VS Code, which I have more familiarity with.

I only knew a little about MarkDown and this was a nice refresher on how it works and the various text editing that can be done with it. I can see how it would be helpful to write documentation in readme files on GitHub.

## Abstract Classes, Interfaces, Lambda Expressions

When first learning about object-oriented programming, it seemed useful to be able to create a class that could be extended. It also seems very useful as a way to keep code DRY.

It was interesting to learn about the code contract that interfaces create. Understanding that it is an unimplementable set of method definitions was a little confusing at first but seeing how they are applied filled in some gaps in my understanding of polymorphism. It is also interesting to see how dependency inversion is applied to achieve loose coupling to an interface. I can see the advantages of letting the programmer decide how the implementation should work. This will change the way I write code.

I was aware that there was something called Lambda expressions but not sure how it worked exactly. Learning about functional interfaces really puts the pieces together as far as understanding how it works. It still is tricky because much is abstracted away but now I understand more about how Lambda expressions work under the hood.


## Open Source Projects
My GitHub knowledge previously focused on being able to do add-commit-push. I was more or less using a project repository as a way of backing up a project or sharing.

I learned more about how branches work. I think it will change the way I work with code. I like that you could create a branch and the main, working branch is safe.

I also learned a lot more about how forks work, as well as how remote and local repositories interact with each other. It seemed confusing, but now I see how the various pieces interact with each other and the importance of doing a pull request on the origin’s upstream.

## Generics
Generics were something that I was aware of and understood from reading documentation was important. I also was using generics and didn't know it when accessing the Collections class. So, I knew how to use classes that implement generics but not how to create my own. It was more abstract before, but now I understand how the classes are written and learned a lot about how a programming language works. It seems like a good way to write clean and reusable code that also uses flexible type safety.


## Lambda Expressions
Learning about the built-in functional interfaces was interesting. It was good practice with writing lambda expressions using the java.util.function package. It also allowed me to practice using generics and understanding the documentation for generic types. I understand how the predefined functional interfaces work. I have a harder time thinking of how to use it in my coding. I think that I could see myself using Predicate as a way to control if/else statements or while loops that rely on a condition that needs to be calculated and has changing arguments. It seems like something that I am going to have to get used to reading and seeing how it is applied before I truly start using it as a solution.

## Collections
Learning about the built in methods that come with Java Collections seemed useful. The options to sort a list or to replace items in it are very useful. I also found the map interface useful, especially the TreeMap that sorts it. Reading about the efficiency of the various methods that sort was also gave me some more perspective on how computers and programming works. It also makes me appreciate the history of the language and the legions of mathematicians who have created these methods in the name of efficiency.
