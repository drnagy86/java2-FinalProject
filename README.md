# Java 2 Final Project
*Fall, 2021*
This is the final project for my CIS-175 Java 2 course at Kirkwood Community College.

## Introduction

Reflecting on the Introduction module, I gained a better understanding of classes. It was good to review and feel confident that I know how to create classes in Java. This includes creating fields, getter and setter methods, constructors, and “to string” methods. It was also useful to learn about IntilliJ code generation. I had never used IntiliJ so it was interesting to learn some of its features and how it is different from VS Code, which I have more familiarity with.

I only knew a little about MarkDown and this was a nice refresher on how it works and the various text editing that can be done with it. I can see how it would be helpful to write documentation in readme files on GitHub.

## Abstract Classes, Interfaces, Lambda Expressions

When first learning about object oriented programing, it seemed uesful to be able to create a class that could be extended. It also seems very useful in or to keep code DRY.

It was interesting to learn about the code contract that interfaces create. Understanding that it is an unimplementable set of method definitions was a little confusing at first but seeing how they are applied filled in some gaps in my understanding of polymorphism. It is also interesting to see how dependency inversion is applied to achieve lose coupling to an interface. I can see the advantages of letting the programmer decide how the implementation should work. This will change the way I write code I feel.

I was aware that there was something called Lambda expressions, but I was not sure how it worked exactly. Learning about functional interfaces really put the pieces together as far as understand how it works.
