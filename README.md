# Java 2 Final Project
*Fall, 2021*
This is the final project for my CIS-175 Java 2 course at Kirkwood Community College.

## Introduction
*In your final project README.md file, write a short reflection (80-160 words) about what you learned or already knew from the Introduction module. Use markdown to create a heading and to format text.*

Reflecting on the Introduction module, I gained a better understanding of classes. It was good to review and feel confident that I know how to create classes in Java. This includes creating fields, getter and setter methods, constructors, and “to string” methods. It was also useful to learn about IntilliJ code generation. I had never used IntiliJ so it was interesting to learn some of its features and how it is different from VS Code, which I have more familiarity with.

I only knew a little about MarkDown and this was a nice refresher on how it works and the various text editing that can be done with it. I can see how it would be helpful to write documentation in readme files on GitHub.
